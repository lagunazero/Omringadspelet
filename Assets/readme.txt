when i'm older, can i scream?

-a game by Ulf Hartelius-



About
---------------
Based closely on a dream (nightmare?) I had in 2013 (probably).

Later intended to add a second stage where the player would take a role as one
of the surrounding entities. Eventually, after a long delay, I decided to scrap
this second stage for two reasons:
1. It was conceived post-dream in order to add a layer of symbolism that I would
have consciously chosen, rather than the subconscious meaning conveyed by the dream.
2. It just wasn't going to happen. I had delayed the "finalization" of the project
for several months already, so apparently I wasn't (at least subconsciously!) all
that interested in doing it anyway.
